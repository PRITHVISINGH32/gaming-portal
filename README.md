🚀 Project Objectives
1. Create and Host a Gaming Portal Website

A homepage was developed using HTML, CSS, and responsive design principles.
The site is hosted using GitHub Pages, making it accessible anywhere with a public URL.

👉 Live Website:
https://your-username.github.io/gaming-portal/

2. Create a GitHub Repository and Add Collaborators

A GitHub repository was created to store the website’s source code.
Multiple users were invited as collaborators to contribute, review, or test the project.

👉 Repository Link:
https://github.com/your-username/gaming-portal

3. Develop a Cloud-Hosted Game and Link It to the Website

A simple browser-based game (“Cloud Clicker”) was developed using a cloud service platform such as Replit, Glitch, or CodeSandbox.

The game demonstrates:

Event handling

Canvas rendering

Basic animation

Cloud hosting

👉 Play the Game:
https://gaming-portal-liart.vercel.app/

The homepage includes buttons linking directly to this game.
